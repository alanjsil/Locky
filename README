Briefly, this program can be used to localize your software. It traverses
recursively over all of your project folders reading C/C++ source-code
files and replacing readable strings with macros whose definitions are
placed on newly created locale.c and locale.h files.

It is mainly intended to create .cd, .ct, and .catalog files for AmigaOS

Usage: Locky -c CDFILE [options]
Options:
  -h            This help message
  -c<catalog>   Catalog descriptor file (REQUIRED)
  -t<tree>      Read sources from <tree> path
  -r            Do recursive scan to get sources while using -t
  -i<pattern>   do not recurse into subdirs matching <pattern>, implies -r
  -p<pattern>   Use <pattern> to source files [#?.(c|h)]
  -f<file>      Localize <file> only.
  -l<locale>    load/save locatized string from/to <locale> path
  -s<pattern>   Only localize strings which match with <pattern>
  -m<value>     Only localize strings which length is greater than <value>
  -b            Check for minstrlen (-m) on the string before localizing it
  -j            Skip all kind of scape sequences and formating tags while using -b
  -a            Count alpha-numeric chars only, upto -m, while using -b
  -g<value>     Maximun length of MSG_#? strings. (default: %d)\n", MSG_MAXLENGTH );
  -o<pattern>   Do not localize files which match with <pattern>.(c|h)
  -n            localize all strings even if duplicated
  -u            Convert localized MSG_#? strings to uppercase (implies -n)
  -x<func,func> Comma separated list of functions whose strings get not localized
  -e            Encode build-in language strings...
  -d            Print debugging messages
  -V            print version info.
